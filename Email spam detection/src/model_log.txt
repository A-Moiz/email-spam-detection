INFO:root:Subject: your power supply is killing your electrical equipment
did you know that    ? ? ?
fact : every electrical system suffers from power surges ?
fact : 80 % of electrical equipment damage is caused by surges - also known
as ' spikes ' . these spikes can damage sensitive electronics in computers
to heavy industrial motors .
fact : these spikes or surges hit your electrical circuits up to 400 , 000
times per hour . your electrical equipment is being gradually and
sometimes suddenly destroyed .
fact : our range of surge arrestors will reduce your operating costs
dramatically by extending the life of all your electrical and electronic
equipment .
motors run cooler , your fluorescent lighting life is doubled . your
equipment works more efficiently and your energy costs fall .
fact : the savings you make in electrical consumption , electrical repairs ,
electronic repair , telephone and data systems protection and lighting
replacements can cover the cost of installing our surge and lightning
arrestors .
even more importantly no sudden , dramatic system failure caused by
lightning , surges and spikes .
now you know     ! !
don ' t let your power supply kill your business !
email me for more information . i look forward to hearing from you .
my very best to you .

network world fusion focus : jason meserve on
security and bug patch alert
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
03 / 06 / 00
dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
by jason meserve
welcome to the security and bug patch alert newsletter !
given the recent spate of high - profile denial - of - service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published , it is
clear that security is a major concern in the it community as it
should be .
with technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center , it departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running as well as secure . no chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the ceo that their e - commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied . stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer  , s mind more than an expensive
super bowl ad .
it  , s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies , never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e - commerce
application . but we  , re here to help .
once a week we  , ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source . we  , ll
also provide other ( hopefully ) useful resources for the security -
conscious it manager .
comments and suggestions are always welcome ! send mail to
jmeserve @ nww . com .
now on with the latest patches and alerts :
security glitch hits foundry switches
from this week  , s network world : a security problem has cropped up in
foundry networks  , serveriron switches that make the devices susceptible

problem with linux htdig package
both freebsd and debian are reporting a problem with the htdig package
that runs on their respective platforms . the problem is with the
htsearch and could allow a user to read any file on the local machine
accessible to the user id that the script is running under ( which in
most cases is  + nobody  , ) .

security and bug patch alert
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
03 / 06 / 00
dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
by jason meserve
welcome to the security and bug patch alert newsletter !
given the recent spate of high - profile denial - of - service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published , it is
clear that security is a major concern in the it community as it
should be .
with technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center , it departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running as well as secure . no chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the ceo that their e - commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied . stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer  , s mind more than an expensive
super bowl ad .
it  , s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies , never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e - commerce
application . but we  , re here to help .
once a week we  , ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source . we  , ll
also provide other ( hopefully ) useful resources for the security -
conscious it manager .
comments and suggestions are always welcome ! send mail to
jmeserve @ nww . com .
now on with the latest patches and alerts :
